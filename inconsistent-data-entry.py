# **This notebook is an exercise in the [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) course.  You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/inconsistent-data-entry).**
# 
# ---
# 

# In this exercise, you'll apply what you learned in the **Inconsistent data entry** tutorial.
# 
# # Setup
# 
# The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up the feedback system.

# In[1]:


from learntools.core import binder
binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.data_cleaning.ex5 import *
print("Setup Complete")


# # Get our environment set up
# 
# The first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries and dataset we'll be using.  We use the same dataset from the tutorial.

# In[2]:


# modules we'll use
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# helpful modules
import fuzzywuzzy
from fuzzywuzzy import process
import chardet

# read in all our data
professors = pd.read_csv("../input/pakistan-intellectual-capital/pakistan_intellectual_capital.csv")

# set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(0)


# Next, we'll redo all of the work that we did in the tutorial.

# In[5]:


# convert to lower case
professors['Country'] = professors['Country'].str.lower()
# remove trailing white spaces
professors['Country'] = professors['Country'].str.strip()

# get the top 10 closest matches to "south korea"
countries = professors['Country'].unique()
matches = fuzzywuzzy.process.extract("south korea", countries, limit=10, scorer=fuzzywuzzy.fuzz.token_sort_ratio)

def replace_matches_in_column(df, column, string_to_match, min_ratio = 47):
    # get a list of unique strings
    strings = df[column].unique()
    
    # get the top 10 closest matches to our input string
    matches = fuzzywuzzy.process.extract(string_to_match, strings, 
                                         limit=10, scorer=fuzzywuzzy.fuzz.token_sort_ratio)

    # only get matches with a ratio > 90
    close_matches = [matches[0] for matches in matches if matches[1] >= min_ratio]

    # get the rows of all the close matches in our dataframe
    rows_with_matches = df[column].isin(close_matches)

    # replace all rows with close matches with the input matches 
    df.loc[rows_with_matches, column] = string_to_match
    
    # let us know the function's done
    print("All done!")
    
replace_matches_in_column(df=professors, column='Country', string_to_match="south korea")
countries = professors['Country'].unique()


# # 1) Examine another column
# 
# Write code below to take a look at all the unique values in the "Graduated from" column.

# In[12]:


university = professors['Graduated from'].unique()
university.sort()
university


# Do you notice any inconsistencies in the data?  Can any of the inconsistencies in the data be fixed by removing white spaces at the beginning and end of cells?
# 
# Once you have answered these questions, run the code cell below to get credit for your work.

# In[9]:


# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
q1.check()


# In[7]:


# Line below will give you a hint
#q1.hint()


# # 2) Do some text pre-processing
# 
# Convert every entry in the "Graduated from" column in the `professors` DataFrame to remove white spaces at the beginning and end of cells.

# In[15]:


# TODO: Your code here


professors['Graduated from'] = professors['Graduated from'].str.strip()

# Check your answer
q2.check()


# In[14]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q2.hint()
#q2.solution()


# # 3) Continue working with countries
# 
# In the tutorial, we focused on cleaning up inconsistencies in the "Country" column.  Run the code cell below to view the list of unique values that we ended with.

# In[16]:


# get all the unique values in the 'City' column
countries = professors['Country'].unique()

# sort them alphabetically and then take a closer look
countries.sort()
countries


# Take another look at the "Country" column and see if there's any more data cleaning we need to do.
# 
# It looks like 'usa' and 'usofa' should be the same country.  Correct the "Country" column in the dataframe to replace 'usofa' with 'usa'.
# 
# **Use the most recent version of the DataFrame (with the whitespaces at the beginning and end of cells removed) from question 2.**

# In[21]:




matches = fuzzywuzzy.process.extract("usa", countries, limit=10, scorer=fuzzywuzzy.fuzz.token_sort_ratio)
replace_matches_in_column(df=professors, column='Country', string_to_match="usa", min_ratio=70)
matches

# Check your answer
q3.check()


# In[18]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q3.hint()
#q3.solution()
