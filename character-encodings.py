# **This notebook is an exercise in the [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) course.  You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/character-encodings).**
#

# 

# In this exercise, you'll apply what you learned in the **Character encodings** tutorial.
# 
# # Setup
# 
# The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up the feedback system.

# In[2]:


from learntools.core import binder
binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.data_cleaning.ex4 import *
print("Setup Complete")


# # Get our environment set up
# 
# The first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries we'll be using.

# In[3]:


# modules we'll use
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# helpful character encoding module
import chardet

# set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(0)


# # 1) What are encodings?
# 
# You're working with a dataset composed of bytes.  Run the code cell below to print a sample entry.

# In[4]:


sample_entry = b'\xa7A\xa6n'
print(sample_entry)
print('data type:', type(sample_entry))


# You notice that it doesn't use the standard UTF-8 encoding. 
# 
# Use the next code cell to create a variable `new_entry` that changes the encoding from `"big5-tw"` to `"utf-8"`.  `new_entry` should have the bytes datatype.

# In[8]:


entry=  sample_entry.decode("big5-tw")
new_entry = entry.encode()

# Check your answer
q1.check()


# In[9]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q1.hint()
#q1.solution()


# # 2) Reading in files with encoding problems
# 
# Use the code cell below to read in this file at path `"../input/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/PoliceKillingsUS.csv"`.  
# 
# Figure out what the correct encoding should be and read in the file to a DataFrame `police_killings`.

# In[12]:


# TODO: Load in the DataFrame correctly.

police_killings = pd.read_csv("../input/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/PoliceKillingsUS.csv", encoding='Windows-1252')

# Check your answer
q2.check()


# Feel free to use any additional code cells for supplemental work.  To get credit for finishing this question, you'll need to run `q2.check()` and get a result of **Correct**.

# In[13]:


police_killings.head()


# In[11]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q2.hint()
#q2.solution()


# # 3) Saving your files with UTF-8 encoding
# 
# Save a version of the police killings dataset to CSV with UTF-8 encoding.  Your answer will be marked correct after saving this file.  
# 
# Note: When using the `to_csv()` method, supply only the name of the file (e.g., `"my_file.csv"`).  This saves the file at the filepath `"/kaggle/working/my_file.csv"`.

# In[16]:


# TODO: Save the police killings dataset to CSV

police_killings.to_csv("my_file.csv")

# Check your answer
q3.check()


# In[15]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q3.hint()
#q3.solution()


# # (Optional) More practice
# 
# Check out [this dataset of files in different character encodings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/character-encoding-examples). Can you read in all the files with their original encodings and them save them out as UTF-8 files?
# 
# If you have a file that's in UTF-8 but has just a couple of weird-looking characters in it, you can try out the [ftfy module](https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and see if it helps. 
# 
# # Keep going
# 
# In the final lesson, learn how to [**clean up inconsistent text entries**](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/inconsistent-data-entry) in your dataset.
